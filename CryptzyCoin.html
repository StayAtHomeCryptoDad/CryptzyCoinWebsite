        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p> Chapter One: On October 12th, 2023, early in the morning around 6AM EST, was the first time I discovered Haycoin. I always wondered what the first tradeable token on Ethereum was and was doing some research on Google. I came across an article detailing the first ERC-20 token deployments on Ethereum. I did some further research and realized it would be impossible for any of those tokens to be traded unless I knew someone who had a supply, as they were deployed before DEX's were a thing. Most of these tokens back in 2015-2016 that were deployed were just tokens listed on CEX's; there was no such thing as an automated market maker yet, which is what Hayden Adams (founder of Uniswap) invented when he created Uniswap.
            <p></p>
            Anyways, I thought to myself, "Realistically, couldn't I just look through the first Uniswap V1 Router transactions to find the first actual tradeable Uniswap token?" So that’s what I did. I did a search on Google for the Uniswap V1 Router address, took a few clicks through some websites to find it as it’s not really commonly used anymore. I found the router contract address and put it into Etherscan, went to the first transactions ever, and realized there was a token called Haycoin.
            <p></p>
            I did some more research on it and realized there were only 12 holders. I started clicking through all the wallets and they all seemed pretty dormant. I then went to the deployer and realized that it was actually deployed by the founder of Uniswap himself, Hayden Adams. After seeing the deployer wallet, I did a search for the term "Haycoin" on Twitter and that's where I found the following tweet from 2019, Hayden's Tweet. It had barely any interactions at that point, and I realized this may be something special.
            <p></p>
            I realized there was no liquidity really in the V2 Uniswap Pool, and no V3 Pair; there were less than 12 holders. The next thing I did is I looked through the most active dormant wallet, which was WijuWiju. I sent him a message on Telegram asking about the 1 $HAY token he owned. I was surprised that he replied pretty quickly. I asked if I could buy the 1 HAY token off him that he had, he replied saying it's not tradeable though, right? and I said yeah it's not right now, but I think it has historic value. At this point, I had no idea if once I got the tokens I could even make it tradeable on V3.
            <p></p>
            After that, he didn’t reply to my messages and then went offline, and I thought to myself, well, I don’t think I’m going to get this guy’s token off him. So I started looking if there was another way to get any tokens at all. I then realized there was $50 in the V1 Uniswap LP pair paired with 0.1 HAY tokens. I then realized that I could buy up the entire pool on Uniswap V1, but it wasn’t that simple. There isn’t a frontend interface anymore for Uniswap V1, so all the transactions had to be made by directly interfacing with the router on Etherscan.
            <p></p>
            So I figured out the right inputs for writing the transactions on Etherscan to get tokens from V1 and then bought up around 0.08 HAY. After that, I realized it was actually working and I could get the rest of the tokens from the pool. After getting the tokens, I then went to Uniswap V3 and paired the 0.08-0.1 HAY with 1.03 ETH. I created the Uniswap Pool (Full Range) then I checked the chart for the V3 pair on Dextools and realized 2 bots auto sold, that took care of 2 of the holders right off the launch. The rest of the wallets were dormant, tagged as writers, Uniswap, etc. so I didn’t think they would end up really selling or coming online, other than Wiju who was online but I didn’t expect he would realize about Hay or touch his tokens.
            <p></p>
            After creating a telegram and a twitter for Haycoin, I made the group public with the link named as "HaycoinERC" shortly after $HAY was starting to be shared in some groups, at this point only 0.1 $HAY was circulating in the supply, the volume starting picking up heavily, I added a buybot to the group and set the link and some people started joining up, the news started being shared in a lot of telegram groups that Haycoin could be something out of the oridinary, volume was taking off and alot of attention across telegram was being generated, with only 0.1 HAY circulating at that time the price started to drastically move up, hitting a all time high of around $14,000,000 a coin which at that point with only 0.1 HAY circulating equaled about 1.4MIL Market Cap.
            <p></p>
            Some sell pressure started from traders which was normal and the price moved down a bit but then, the next thing that happened made the chat go silent. A 28 ETH Sell nuked the LP pool to almost 0, nuking the price back down to where it just started at, everyone was freaking out, fudding, and people starting looking into what happened, people soon after realized it was WijuWiju.eth who sold, Wiju was the first boss battle of the community, after he sold the community found his twitter and started replying to him and he eventually joined up the telegram.
            <p></p>
            After Wiju's sell there were more tokens in the circulation, which caused the market cap to change again due the calculation of market cap being simply price x circulating supply. The next thing that happened took the community by shook, Wiju burnt tokens and added to liquidity creating another wave of fomo moving the price from almost nothing back up in a strong FOMO wave. But there were still some issues people saw after some community members tracked down the other dormant wallets by searching their ENS's on twitter and saw a semi active dormant wallet who was named John Palmer. In the next chapter we will learn about the John Palmer Saga and start to dive into the Battle Of Kyoro.
